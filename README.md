# COS 485 Project S20

## Authors
Daniel Chae (2020 COS) and Matthew Yeh (2020 COS)

Under advising from Dr. Larry Jackel

## File System
mnist-lenet5*.py files are all the different runs that were put into tigergpu. Namely, all of the experiments conducted under approach 2 in the paper were put into tigergpu. The mnist-lenet5-fair.py file has the run where we even out the presentations of samples across different n. Long vs short files are just longer versus shorter runs of training the LeNet5 model.

manual_graphing folder has its own README in it.

Images and output logs (most but not all) were put into the folder.

Approach 1 was completed on a Colab notebook: \url{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_ul8d6x-NZ0O3jSxyx4frhnuwqV5AW94?usp=sharing}
